OPEN IR SECURITY - README.MD FILE - V1

---------------------------------
How to run the app:


1. Create a user account.

When the app is first opened, it will prompt you to either log in with an existing account, or create a new account.
After creating a new user account for the first time, the app will send you an email containing your unique user ID. 
This ID will be required during the set-up of all new IR devices attached to your account. 

2. Attach a new device to your account.

Plug the OpenIRSecurity hardware into your computer using the included microUSB. Run the installer script. [TODO:
Include more details about how to run the script once we have written it and figured out the details of the process] 
This script will install the OpenIRSecurity program on your ESP. Setup will require the user ID emailed to you during
the signup process, as well as your local WiFi username and password. Once the script has executed successfully, 
open your application and go to the “Add New Device” page. Name your new device. Triggers should appear automatically
on your home screen.
